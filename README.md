Domain Adaptation

## How would the performance when applied to images captured on YouTube with classifiers learned from ImageNet data?

The performance is poor. Because the images captured on ImageNet and YouTube are very fundamental different. For example, the difference is that the images in the video domain has low resolution, motion blur and pose variety.
As a result, the reason for the poor performance is that the source domain (labeled data) and target domain (unlabeled data) are different.
